 <h4> <span class="prim_example">reduce <i>reporter-task</i> <i>list</i></span> </h4> 
 <p> Reduces a list from left to right using the given task, resulting in a single value. This means, for example, that <code>reduce [?1 + ?2] [1 2 3 4]</code> is equivalent to <i>(((1 + 2) + 3) + 4)</i>. If <i>list</i> has a single item, that item is reported. It is an error to reduce an empty list. </p>
 <p> The first input passed to the task is the result so far, and the second input is the next item in the list. </p>
 <p> Since it can be difficult to develop an intuition about what <code>reduce</code> does, here are some simple examples which, while not useful in themselves, may give you a better understanding of this primitive: </p>
 <pre>
show reduce + [1 2 3]
=&gt; 6
show reduce - [1 2 3]
=&gt; -4
show reduce [?2 - ?1] [1 2 3]
=&gt; 2
show reduce [?1] [1 2 3]
=&gt; 1
show reduce [?2] [1 2 3]
=&gt; 3
show reduce sentence [[1 2] [3 [4]] 5]
=&gt; [1 2 3 [4] 5]
show reduce [fput ?2 ?1] (fput [] [1 2 3 4 5])
=&gt; [5 4 3 2 1]
</pre> 
 <p> Here are some more useful examples: </p>
 <pre>
;; find the longest string in a list
to-report longest-string [strings]
  report reduce
    [ifelse-value (length ?1 &gt;= length ?2) [?1] [?2]]
    strings
end

show longest-string ["hi" "there" "!"]
=&gt; "there"

;; count the number of occurrences of an item in a list
to-report occurrences [x the-list]
  report reduce
    [ifelse-value (?2 = x) [?1 + 1] [?1]] (fput 0 the-list)
end

show occurrences 1 [1 2 1 3 1 2 3 1 1 4 5 1]
=&gt; 6

;; evaluate the polynomial, with given coefficients, at x
to-report evaluate-polynomial [coefficients x]
  report reduce [(x * ?1) + ?2] coefficients
end

;; evaluate 3x^2 + 2x + 1 at x = 4
show evaluate-polynomial [3 2 1] 4
=&gt; 57
