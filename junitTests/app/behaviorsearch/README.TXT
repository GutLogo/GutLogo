INSTALLATION:

On Mac/Linux:  Copy the contents of the zip archive into the "NetLogo 4.1" application folder.  Everthing should end up in the "behaviorsearch" subfolder, within the NetLogo folder.

On Windows:  You should have already run the installer, which is why you're reading this.  (Hopefully you installed BehaviorSearch into a subfolder of the NetLogo folder.  Otherwise you'll need to uninstall it and try again.)

RUNNING:

Windows:  Run the shortcut on the Desktop, or Start Menu->NetLogo->BehaviorSearch
Mac: Run the "behaviorsearch_gui.command" script in the "behaviorsearch" folder.
Linux: Run the "behaviorsearch_gui.sh" script in the "behaviorsearch" folder.


TROUBLESHOOTING:

If you're having trouble running/using BehaviorSearch, feel free to contact me at feedback@behaviorsearch.org , and I'll try to help.
