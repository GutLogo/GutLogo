    <p>
      This section of the manual explains the function of each element in
      NetLogo's user interface.
    <p>
      In NetLogo, you have the choice of viewing models found in the Models
      Library, adding to existing models, or creating your own models. The
      NetLogo interface was designed to meet all these needs.
    <p>
      The interface can be divided into two main parts: NetLogo menus, and
      the main NetLogo window. The main window is divided into tabs.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#menus">Menus</a></li>

    </h2>
    <p id="menus">
      On a Mac, if you are running the NetLogo application, the menu bar is
      located at the top of the screen. On other platforms, the menu bar is
      found at the top of the NetLogo window.

            "Undo" doesn't take this operation into account, so you won't want to save unless you're satisfied with the changes.

      At the top of NetLogo's main window are three tabs labeled
      &quot;Interface&quot;, &quot;Info&quot; and &quot;Code&quot; . Only
      one tab at a time can be visible, but you can switch between them by
      clicking on the tabs at the top of the window.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/interfacetoolbar.gif">
    <p>
      Right below the row of tabs is a toolbar containing a row of
      controls. The controls available vary from tab to tab.
    <h2>
      <a>Interface Tab</a>
    </h2>
    <p id="interface">
      The Interface tab is where you watch your model run. It also has
      tools you can use to inspect and alter what's going on inside the
      model.
    <p>
      When you first open NetLogo, the Interface tab is empty except for
      the view, where the turtles and patches appear, and the Command
      Center, which allows you to issue NetLogo commands.
    <h3>
      <a>Working with
      interface elements</a>
    </h3>
    <p id="interfaceelements">
      The toolbar on the Interface tab contains buttons that let you edit,
      delete, and create items in the Interface tab and a menu that lets
      you select different interface items (such as buttons and sliders).
      <!-- need to scale this one down slightly to fit in PDF without clipping -->
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/image007.gif">
    <p>
      The buttons in the toolbar are described below.
    <p>
      <strong>Adding:</strong> To add an interface element, select the element from
      the drop down menu. Note that the Add button stays down. Then click
      on the white area below the toolbar. (If the menu is already showing
      the right type, you can just press the Add button instead of using
      the menu again.)
    <p>
      <strong>Selecting:</strong> To select an interface element, drag a rectangle
      around it with your mouse. A gray border with black handles will
      appear around the element to show it is selected.
    <p>
      <strong>Selecting multiple items:</strong> You can select multiple interface
      elements at the same time by including them in the rectangle you
      drag. If multiple elements are selected, one of them is the
      &quot;key&quot; item, which means that if you use the
      &quot;Edit&quot; or &quot;Delete&quot; buttons on the Interface
      Toolbar, only the key item is affected. The key item's border is
      darker gray.
    <p>
      <strong>Unselecting:</strong> To unselect all interface elements, click the
      mouse on the white background of the Interface tab. To unselect an
      individual element, right-click the element and choose
      &quot;Unselect&quot; from the popup menu.
    <p>
      <strong>Editing:</strong> To change the characteristics of an interface
      element, select the element, then press the &quot;Edit&quot; button
      on the Interface toolbar. You may also double click the element once
      it is selected. A third way to edit an element is to right-click it
      and choose &quot;Edit&quot; from the popup menu. If you use this last
      method, it is not necessary to select the element first.
    <p>
      <strong>Moving:</strong> Select the interface element, then drag it with your
      mouse to its new location. If you hold down the shift key while
      dragging, the element will move only straight up and down or straight
      left and right.
    <p>
      <strong>Resizing:</strong> Select the interface element, then drag the black
      &quot;handles&quot; in the selection border.
    <p>
      <strong>Deleting:</strong> Select the element or elements you want to delete,
      then press the &quot;Delete&quot; button on the Interface toolbar.
      You may also delete an element by right-clicking it and choosing
      &quot;Delete&quot; from the popup menu. If you use this latter
      method, it is not necessary to select the element first.
    <p>

        <td>
          A button is either <em>once</em> or <em>forever</em>. When you click
          on a once button, it executes its instructions once. The forever
          button executes the instructions over and over, until you click
          on the button again to stop the action. If you have assigned an
          action key to the button, pressing the corresponding keyboard key
          will act just like a button press when the button is in focus.
          Buttons with action keys have a letter in the upper right corner
          of the button to show what the action key is. If the keyboard
          focus is in another interface element such as the Command Center,
          pressing the action key won't trigger the button. The letter
          in the upper right hand corner of the button will be dimmed in
          this situation. To enable action keys, click in the white
          background of the Interface tab.

    <ul>
      <li>The slider lets you control how fast the model runs. Slower can
      be valuable since some models run so fast they're hard to follow.
      You can also fast-forward the model by moving the slider to the

      <li>The view updates checkbox controls whether view updates happen at

    <p>
      &quot;Continuous&quot; updates means that NetLogo updates (that is,
      redraws) the view many times a second, regardless of what is going on
      in the model. &quot;Tick-based&quot; updates means that the view only
      updates when the tick counter advances. (For a fuller discussion of
      view updates, see the <a href="programming.html">Programming
      Guide</a>.)
    <h3>
      <a>The 2D and 3D views</a>
    </h3>
    <p id="views">
      The large black square in the Interface tab is the 2D view. It's
      a visual representation of the NetLogo world of turtles and patches.
      Initially it's all black because the patches are black and there
      are no turtles yet. You can open the 3D View, an alternate visual
      representation of the world, by right clicking (ctrl-clicking on Mac)
      on the View and choosing &quot;Switch to 3D View&quot; (this option
      is also available in the "Tools" menu).
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/open3d-context.gif">
    <p>
      There are a number of settings for the View (accessible by editing the View,
      or by pressing the &quot;Settings...&quot; button in the Interface
      Toolbar):
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/settings.gif">
    <p>
      Notice that the settings are broken up into three groups. There are
      world, view, and ticks counter settings. World settings affect the
      properties of the world that the turtles live in (changing them may
      require resetting the world). View and tick counter settings only
      affect the appearance, changing them will not affect the outcome of
      the model.
    <p>
      The world settings allow you to define the boundaries and topology of
      the world. At the top of the left side of the world panel you can
      choose a location for the origin of the world either
      &quot;Center&quot;, &quot;Corner&quot;, &quot;Edge&quot;, or
      &quot;Custom&quot;. By default the world has a center configuration
      where (0,0) is at the center of the world and you define the number
      of patches from the center to the right and left boundaries and the
      number of patches from the center to the top and bottom boundaries.
      For example: if you set Max-Pxcor = 10, then Min-Pxcor will
      automatically be set to -10, thus there are 10 patches to the left of
      the origin and 10 patches to the right of patch 0 0, for a total of
      21 patches in each row.
    <p>
      A Corner configuration allows you to define the location of the
      origin as one of the corners of the world, upper left, upper right,
      lower left, or lower right. Then you define the far boundary in the x
      and y directions. For example if you choose to put the origin in the
      lower left corner of the world you define the right and top
      (positive) boundaries.
    <p>
      Edge mode allows you to place the origin along one of the edges (x or
      y) then define the far boundary in that direction and both boundaries
      in the other. For example if you select edge mode along the bottom of
      the world, you must also define the top boundary, as well as the left
      and the right.
    <p>
      Finally, Custom mode allows you to place the origin at any location
      in the world, though patch 0 0 must still exist in the world.
    <p>
      As you change the settings you will notice that the changes you make
      are reflected in the preview on the right side of the panel which
      shows the origin and the boundaries. The width and height of the
      world are displayed below the preview.
    <p>
      Also below the preview there are two checkboxes, the world wrap
      settings. These allow you to control the topology of the world.
      Notice when you click the check boxes the preview indicates which
      directions allow wrapping, and the name of the topology is displayed
      next to the world dimensions. See the <a href="programming.html#topology">Topology section of the Programming
      Guide</a> for more information.
    <p>
      The view settings allow you to customize the look of the view without
      changing the world. Changing view settings will never force a world
      reset. To change the size of the 2D View adjust the &quot;Patch
      Size&quot; setting, measured in pixels. This does not change the
      number of patches, only how large the patches appear in the 2D View.
      (Note that the patch size does not affect the 3D View, as you can
      simply make the 3D View larger by making the window larger.)
    <p>
      The font size setting lets you control the size of turtle, patch, and
      link labels.
    <p>
      The frame rate controls how often the view gets updated. This can
      have a dramatic effect on the default speed at which a model runs.
      For more details, see the <a href="programming.html#updates">view
      updates section</a> of the Programming Guide.
    <p>
      The &quot;Smooth edges&quot; checkbox controls the use of
      anti-aliasing in the 3D view only and only appears when editing from
      the 3D view. Unchecking it makes lines appear more jagged but may
      speed up rendering.
    <p>
      Tick counter settings control the appearance of the tick counter
      which is visible (or not) in the view control strip.
    <p>
      Turtle, patch and link monitors are easily available through the
      View, just right-click on the turtle or patch you want to inspect,
      and choose &quot;inspect turtle ...&quot; or &quot;inspect patch
      ...&quot; from the popup menu. You can also watch, follow or ride a
      turtle by selecting the appropriate item in the turtle sub-menu.
      (Turtle, patch and link monitors can also be opened from the Tools
      menu or by using the <a href="dictionary.html#inspect"><code>inspect</code></a> command.)
    <p>
      Some NetLogo models let you interact with the turtles and patches
      with your mouse by clicking and dragging in the View.
    <h4>
      Manipulating the 3D View
    </h4>
    <p>
      At the bottom of the window there are buttons to move the observer,
      or change the perspective from which you are looking at the world.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/image024.gif">
    <p>
      A blue cross appears at the current focus point as you adjust these
      settings. The little blue triangle will always point along the y-axis
      in the positive direction, so you can orient yourself in case you get
      lost.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/image025.gif">
    <p>
      To look at the world from a different angle, press the
      &quot;rotate&quot; button, then click and drag the mouse. The
      observer will continue to face the same point as before (where the
      blue cross is) but its position in the relation to the xy-plane will
      change.
    <p>
      To move closer or farther away from the world or the agent you are
      watching, following or riding, press the &quot;zoom&quot; button and
      drag up and down. Note when you are in follow or ride mode zooming
      will switch you between ride and follow, since ride is just a special
      case of follow where the distance at which you are following is 0.
    <p>
      To change the position of the observer without changing the direction
      it is facing select the &quot;move&quot; button and drag the mouse
      inside the 3D View while holding down the mouse button.
    <p>
      To allow the mouse position and state to be passed to the model
      select the &quot;interact&quot; button and it will function just as
      the mouse does in the 2D view.
    <p>
      To return the observer and focus point to their default positions
      press the &quot;Reset Perspective&quot; button (or use the <a href="dictionary.html#reset-perspective"><code>reset-perspective</code></a>
      command).
    <h5 class="minor-section-header">Fullscreen Mode</h5>
      To enter fullscreen mode, press the &quot;Full Screen&quot; button,
      to exit fullscreen mode, press the Esc key.
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Fullscreen mode doesn't work on every computer. It
      depends on your graphics card. See the <a href="requirements.html#threed">System Requirements</a> for details.

    <h5 class="minor-section-header">3D Shapes</h5>
      Some shapes are automatically mapped to true 3D counterparts in the
      3D view. For example, the 2D circle shape becomes a sphere in the 3D
      view.
    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <th>Shape name</th>
        <th>3D shape</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>default</td>
        <td>3D turtle shape</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>circle</td>
        <td>sphere</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>dot</td>
        <td>small sphere</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>square</td>
        <td>cube</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>triangle</td>
        <td>cone</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>line</td>
        <td>3D line</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>cylinder</td>
        <td>3D cylinder</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>line-half</td>
        <td>3D line-half</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>car</td>
        <td>3D car</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      All other shapes are based on their 2D forms. If a shape is a
      rotatable shape, it is assumed to be a top view and it is extruded as
      if through a cookie cutter and oriented parallel to the xy-plane, as
      in Ants.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/image026.gif">
    <p>
      Or, if a shape is non-rotatable, it is assumed to be a side view, and
      it is drawn always facing the observer, as in Wolf Sheep Predation.
    <p class="screenshot">

    <h3>
      <a>Command Center</a>
    </h3>
    <p id="commandcenter">
      The Command Center allows you to issue commands directly, without
      adding them to the model's procedures. This is useful for
      inspecting and manipulating agents on the fly.
    <p>
      (<a href="tutorial2.html">Tutorial #2: Commands</a> is an
      introduction to using commands in the Command Center.)
    <p>
      Let's take a look at the design of the Command Center.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/image006.gif">
      <!--<p>You will notice there is a large display box, an agent popup menu
(observer&gt;), a "clear" button, a button (with the double-headed arrow)
to relocate the command center to
the right side of the window, and the history popup menu (in the lower
right, with the little
black triangle).-->
    <p>
      The smaller box, below the large box, is where you type a command.
      After typing it press the Return or Enter key to run it.
    <p>
      To the left of where you type is a popup menu that initially says
      &quot;observer&gt;&quot;. You can choose either observer, turtles, or
      patches, to specify which agents run the command you type.
    <p>
      Tip: a quicker way to change agent types is to use the Tab key.
    <h5 class="minor-section-header">Reporters</h5>
      If you enter a reporter into the Command Center, the <a href="dictionary.html#show">show</a> command will be inserted before it
      automatically.
    <h5 class="minor-section-header">Accessing previous commands</h5>
      After you type a command, it appears in the large scrolling box above
      the command line. You can use Copy on the Edit menu in this area to
      copy commands and then paste them elsewhere, such as the Code tab.
    <p>
      You can also access previous commands using the history popup, which
      is the small downward pointing triangle to the right of where you
      type commands. Click on the triangle and a menu of previously typed
      commands appears, so you can pick one to use again.
    <p>
      Tip: a quicker way to access previous commands is with the up and
      down arrow keys on your keyboard.
    <h5 class="minor-section-header">Clearing</h5>
      To clear the large scrolling area containing previous commands and
      output, click &quot;clear&quot; in the top right corner.
    <p>
      To clear the history popup menu, choose &quot;Clear History&quot; on
      that menu.
    <h5 class="minor-section-header">Arranging</h5>
      You can hide and show the command center using the Hide Command
      Center and Show Command Center items on the Tools menu.
    <p>
      To resize the command center, drag the bar that separates it from the
      model interface. Or, click one of the little arrows on the right end
      of the bar to make the command center either very big or hidden
      altogether.
    <p>
      To switch between a vertical command center and a horizontal one,
      click the button with the double-headed arrow, just to the left of
      &quot;Clear&quot;.
    <h3>
      <a>Plots</a>
    </h3>
    <p id="plots">
      When the mouse pointer is over the white area of a plot, the x and y
      coordinates of the mouse location appear. (Note that the mouse
      location might not correspond exactly to any actual data points in
      the plot. If you need to know the exact coordinates of plotted
      points, use the Export Plot menu item and inspect the resulting file
      in another program.)
    <p>
      When you create a plot, as with all widgets, the edit dialog
      automatically appears.
    <p>
      <img src="./images/interface/plot.gif" alt="Plot Editor">
    <p>
      Many of the fields are fairly self-explanatory, such as the name of
      the plot, labels for the x and y axes, ranges for the axes, and the
      &quot;Show legend?&quot; checkbox.
    <p>
      If Auto Scale? is checked the x and y changes will automatically
      readjust as points are added to the plot if they are outside the
      current range.
    <p>
      Under &quot;Plot setup commands&quot; and &quot;Plot update
      commands&quot; you can enter commands that will automatically be run
      at appropriate times. Click the little triangle to open the text box
      for the commands. Plot commands are explained in more detail in the
      Plotting section of the Programming Guide.
    <h4>
      Plot Pens
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the plot pens section of the dialog, you can create and customize
      your plot's pens. Each table row represents a pen. By default
      there is one pen named &quot;default&quot;. (You may wish to change
      it to a name that has meaning in your model.)
    <p>
      To edit the color of a pen click the colored rectangle to the left of
      the pen's name. This will bring up a dialog that allows you to
      set the color to one of the NetLogo base hues or a custom color using
      the color swatches.
    <p>
      To edit the pen's name, double click the name.
    <p>
      In the &quot;Pen Update Commands&quot; column you can enter commands
      that will be run when <code>reset-ticks</code>, <code>tick</code>, or
      <code>update-plots</code> commands are run. This is explained in more
      detail in the Plotting section of the Programming Guide.
    <p>
      The last column has two buttons. Clicking the pencil icon will bring
      up an edit dialog with additional pen settings. The trash can button
      deletes the pen.
    <h5 class="minor-section-header">Plot Pen Advanced Settings</h5>
    <p>
      Clicking a pen's edit button will open this dialog:
    <p>
      <img src="./images/interface/plot-pen-advanced.gif" alt="Plot Editor">
    <ul>
      <li>Mode allows you to change the appearance of the plot pen: line,
      bar (for a bar chart), or point (a scatter plot of individual
      points).
      <li>Interval is the amount by which x advances every time you use the
      <code>plot</code> command.
      <li>If the &quot;Show in legend&quot; checkbox is checked the
      selected pen will be a part of the legend in the upper right hand
      corner of the plot.
      <li>In the &quot;Setup commands&quot; field you can enter commands
      that will be run when <code>reset-ticks</code> or
      <code>setup-plots</code> runs.
      <li>In the &quot;Update commands&quot; field you can enter commands
      that will be run when <code>tick</code> or <code>update-plots</code>
      runs. This field reappears in the advanced dialog to provide space
      for editing lengthier sets of commands.
      </ul>
    <p>
      For more detailed information on how each of these features works you
      can see the Plotting Section of the Programming Guide.
    <h3>
      <a>Sliders</a>
    </h3>
    <p id="sliders">
      A slider has an associated global variable. Moving the slider changes
      the variable's value.
    <p>
      When you place a slider in the Interface tab the edit dialog
      automatically opens, as with all widgets. Most of the fields will be
      familiar. However, it is important to notice the minimum, maximum and
      increment fields will take any reporter, not just constants. So, for
      example, you could make the minimum <a href="dictionary.html#min-pcor"><code>min-pxcor</code></a> and the maximum
      <a href="dictionary.html#max-pcor"><code>max-pxcor</code></a> and the
      slider bounds will automatically adjust when you change the size of
      the world.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/sliderbounds.gif">
    <h3>
      <a>Agent Monitors</a>
    </h3>
    <p id="agentmonitors">
      Agent monitors display both the values of all the variables for a
      particular agent and a mini-view that shows the agent and a small
      area around it.
    <p>
      You can open agent monitors through the Tools menu or the <a href="dictionary.html#inspect"><code>inspect</code></a> command.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/agentmonitor1.gif">
    <p>
      You can zoom in or out using the slider beneath the view and you can
      <a href="dictionary.html#watch"><code>watch</code></a> the agent in the
      main view using the <code>watch-me</code> button.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/agentmonitor2.gif">
    <p>
      Below the slider the current value of each agent variable is
      displayed. You can enter a new value. It will be as if, for example,
      the code <code>set pcolor ...</code> had run.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/agentmonitor3.gif">
    <p>
      Below the agent variable area there is a mini-command center. Rather
      than running code as the observer, or talking to all of the turtles,
      patches, or links, the code entered in this command center is run
      only by this agent.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/agentmonitor4.gif">
    <p>
      You can close an agent monitor by clicking the box in the upper left
      corner, or by pressing the Esc key. If you hold down shift while you
      click the box all open agent monitors will close or you can close all
      the agent monitors using the &quot;Close All Monitors&quot; option in
      the Tools Menu.
    <h2>
      <a>Code tab</a>
    </h2>
    <p id="procedures">
      The Code tab is where the code for the model is stored. Commands you
      only want to use immediately go in the Command Center; commands you
      want to save and use later, over and over again, are found in the
      Code tab.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/codetab.gif">
    <p>
      To determine if the code has any errors, you may press the
      &quot;Check&quot; button. If there are any syntax errors, the Code
      tab will turn red, the code that contains the error will be
      highlighted, and an error message will appear.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/codetaberror.gif">
    <p>
      Switching tabs also causes the code to be checked, so if you just
      switch tabs, pressing the Check button first isn't necessary.
    <p>
      To find a fragment of code in the procedures, click on the
      &quot;Find&quot; button in the Code toolbar and the Find dialog will
      appear.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/image028.gif">
    <p>
      You may enter a word or phrase to find, and optionally also a new
      word or phrase to replace it with. The &quot;Ignore case&quot;
      checkbox controls whether the capitalization must be the same to
      indicate a match.
    <p>
      If the &quot;Wrap around&quot; checkbox is checked, the entire Code
      tab will be checked for the phrase, starting at the cursor position.
      When it reaches the end it will return to the top, otherwise only the
      area from the cursor position to the end of the Code tab will be
      searched. The &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Previous&quot; buttons will
      move down and up to find another occurrence of the search phrase.
    <p>
      &quot;Replace&quot; changes the currently selected phrase with the
      replace phrase and &quot;Replace &amp; Find&quot; changes the
      selected phrase and moves to the next occurrence. &quot;Replace
      All&quot; will change all instances of the find phrase in the search
      area with the replace phrase.
    <p>
      To find a particular procedure definition in your code, use the
      &quot;Procedures&quot; popup menu in the Code tab. The menu lists all
      procedures in alphabetical order.
    <p>
      The &quot;Shift Left&quot;, &quot;Shift Right&quot;,
      &quot;Comment&quot;, and &quot;Uncomment&quot; items on the Edit menu
      are used in the Code tab to change the indentation level of your code
      or add and remove semicolons, which mark comments, from sections of
      code.
    <p>
      For more information about writing procedures, read <a href="tutorial3.html">Tutorial #3: Procedures</a> and the <a href="programming.html">Programming Guide</a>.
    <h3>
      <a>Includes Menu</a>
    </h3>
    <p id="includes">
      <strong>Caution:</strong> The includes facility is new and experimental.
    <p>
      When you add the <a href="dictionary.html#includes">__includes</a>
      keyword to a model a menu to the right of the procedures menu
      appears. This is the includes menu which lists all the NetLogo source
      files (.nls) included in this file.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/includesmenu.gif">
    <p>
      You can choose a file name from the menu to open a tab for that file,
      or you can open a new or existing file using New Source File and Open
      Source File, respectively.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/includesmenuopen.gif">
    <p>
      Once you've opened new tabs they become accessible from the Tabs
      menu, and you can use the keyboard to move from tab to tab (Command +
      number on Mac, Control + number on other operating systems).
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/tabsmenu.gif">
    <h3>
      Automatic indentation
    </h3>
    <p>
      When the Indent Automatically checkbox is selected, NetLogo will
      automatically attempt to align your code in a logically structured
      format. For example, when you open a set of square brackets
      &quot;[&quot; (perhaps after an <code>if</code> statement), NetLogo will
      automatically add spaces so that the following lines of code are two
      spaces further indented than the bracket. When you close the square
      brackets the closing bracket will be lined up with the matching open
      bracket.
    <p class="screenshot">
      <img alt="screen shot" src="images/interface/tabified-code.gif">
    <p>
      NetLogo will try to indent the code as you type, but you can also
      press the tab key anywhere on any line to ask NetLogo to indent the
      line immediately. Or, you can select a whole region of code and press
      the tab key to re-indent all of it.
    <h2>
      <a>International Usage</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Character sets
    </h3>
    <p id="i18n">
      NetLogo always saves and loads models in the UTF-8 character
      encoding, which includes a wide range of international characters.
    <p>
      If you are in a locale other than U.S. English, let us know if you
      have any trouble using your local character set.
    <p>
      The <a href="transition.html">Transition Guide</a> has advice on
      converting models containing international characters from earlier
      NetLogo versions.
    <h3>
      Languages
    </h3>
    <p>
      Most of NetLogo's GUI, and some of its error messages, are now
      &quot;internationalized&quot;. This means that it is now possible to
      display NetLogo in different languages.
    <p>
      We say &quot;possible&quot; here because the current release of
      NetLogo only supports English, Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and Japanese.
    <p>
      The work on internationalization is not complete. We are asking for
      help from the user community in helping us localize items such as the
      menus and error messages.
    <h4>
      Default language
    </h4>
    <p>
      By default, NetLogo uses the same language your operating system is
      set to, if available. (If unavailable, you get English.)
    <p>
      You can record a preference for a different language by changing the
      "User Interface Language" option in the preferences dialog. Once a new
      language is chosen you will have to restart NetLogo.
    <h3>
      Support for translators
    </h3>
    <p>
      We hope NetLogo will become available in many different languages. If
      you would like to translate NetLogo to your language, see <a href="https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/Localization" target="_blank">this wiki
      page</a> for instructions.
